title: 'Using APIs in Python for Data Collection (Part 1)'
excerpt: "APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are useful to anyone who wants to access and use data or services that are provided by other applications or systems. APIs set a standard way for different applications and systems to communicate and share data with each other. This way, we donâ€™t have to build every app or dataset from scratch."
