## üëã Hey Friends,

Getting into a new field of research requires reading dozens of landmark and seminal papers to understand that field‚Äôs foundations. This manual process often involves:

- Searching keywords on Google Scholar
- Finding papers
- Polling friends, advisors, colleagues, and other experts for recommendations

It's an ad-hoc process that can take months.

Conducting a proper, methodical literature review is even more time-intensive but crucial. It involves establishing a method, identifying the correct keywords, and finding the right databases.

# Introducing Scholar Scraper: A Tool in The Academic‚Äôs Toolkit

I‚Äôve been pondering how to utilize **ChatGPT** to assist researchers in summarizing a field‚Äôs most crucial papers quickly and digestibly. Introducing the first tool in **The Academic‚Äôs Toolkit**: **Scholar Scraper**!
