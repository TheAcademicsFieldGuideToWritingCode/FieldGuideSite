# ChatGPT is a Great Coding Tutor — If you ask it the Right Questions

I love teaching.

As soon as I had the chance, I became a teaching assistant for computer science courses at the University of Guelph. I got to teach labs introductory programming in C, object oriented in Java, and even a little UI design.

One of the most interesting results of teaching for so long is that you also build a better understanding of how you learn.

See, I get a real kick out of trying to find the precise wording, the right metaphor, the perfect alignment of explanation and student. If I explain something once and a student doesn’t get it it’s not because they’re stupid, it’s because I haven’t connected with them the right way yet. That’s a problem we — the student and I — can solve together.

But I can also turn this inward.

Let’s say I’m learning a new syntax in python — list comprehensions for example— and I don’t understand one explanation I find online, I can approach that misunderstanding the same way I’d approach it with one of my own students. I’ll search for a new explanation, reformulate the question, and find different examples. This is extremely effective, but a slow process with google, books, and trial and error practice.

All of this is made so much faster with ChatGPT as a tutor.

With ChatGPT, the bot and I can co-create new explanations. We can iterate — do I want an explanation in the form of a metaphor, no? How about concrete code examples? That didn’t work. Let’s try an abstract code example.

Together ChatGPT and I explore how I learn through iteration — co-creating the most effective learning environment for me.

## Teaching ChatGPT to be your Personal Coding Tutor

I like to learn by doing.

I find I’m much more driven to learn programming when I have a project I’m excited about. Without that context, strings of syntax are meaningless to me.

So we’re going to start with a project — using the twitter API via tweepy to collect tweets by Obama — and then as we uncover things I don’t understand, we’ll dive into some techniques I use to get chatGPT to explain it to me.

```python
# First prompt to ChatGPT
we’re going to build a python script using tweepy to collect tweets written by Obama. Help me code that
```

It spat this out

```python
import tweepy

# your Twitter API credentials
consumer_key = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"
consumer_secret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
access_token_secret = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"

# authorize tweepy to access the Twitter API
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

# create the API object
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# the user whose tweets we want to collect
username = "BarackObama"

# initialize a list to hold all the tweets
all_tweets = []

# make initial request for most recent tweets (200 is the maximum allowed count)
new_tweets = api.user_timeline(screen_name=username, count=200)

# save most recent tweets
all_tweets.extend(new_tweets)

# save the id of the oldest tweet less one
oldest = all_tweets[-1].id - 1

# keep grabbing tweets until there are no tweets left to grab
while len(new_tweets) > 0:
    print(f"getting tweets before {oldest}")
    
    # all subsequent requests use the max_id parameter to prevent duplicates
    new_tweets = api.user_timeline(screen_name=username, count=200, max_id=oldest)
    
    # save most recent tweets
    all_tweets.extend(new_tweets)
    
    # update the id of the oldest tweet less one
    oldest = all_tweets[-1].id - 1
    
    print(f"Number of tweets downloaded so far: {len(all_tweets)}")

# transform the tweets into a more easily manipulable format
outtweets = [[tweet.id_str, tweet.created_at, tweet.text] for tweet in all_tweets]

# save the tweets to a CSV file
import csv
with open(f'{username}_tweets.csv', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["id","created_at","text"])
    writer.writerows(outtweets)
```

Now, as my long term readers know, I’m a C programmer at heart. So, lines like this are gibberish to me.

```python
# transform the tweets into a more easily manipulable format
outtweets = [[tweet.id_str, tweet.created_at, tweet.text] for tweet in all_tweets]
```

Let’s get chatGPT to explain this in 3 different ways.

### Explain Plainly

The first thing I want to do is try to tease apart, in the broadest sense, what this code does. Not how it does it, but what the point of the code is — its purpose. To do this, I ask ChatGPT to explain the code in plain English.

**The Prompt**

```plaintext
Can you explain what this code does in plain English? Use a metaphor or something to help me understand what it’s doing. I want to understand the purpose of this code right now, we’ll get to the details later.
```

```python
outtweets = [[tweet.id_str, tweet.created_at, tweet.text] for tweet in all_tweets]
```

ChatGPT confidently explains it to me

> Certainly! Imagine you have a basket of apples (all_tweets) and each apple (tweet) has a unique ID, a timestamp of when it was picked, and a message written on its skin. The purpose of this code is to create a new collection (outtweets) of apples, where each apple’s information is neatly organized on a small card.
> 
> In other words, this code takes a list of tweets (all_tweets) and creates a new list (outtweets) containing the essential information of each tweet, such as its ID, creation time, and text. The new list consists of smaller lists, each holding the information of a single tweet.

### Explain by Translation to pseudocode or a Familiar Language

Okay, so we know the purpose of this list comprehension, now let’s start figuring out how it achieves its purpose.

Here I’m going to ask ChatGPT to explain the code again by writing it out in pseudo-code, and comparing it piece by piece.

Here’s the prompt:

```plaintext
can you write some pseudo-code that does the same thing as the following python code? Comment the pseudo-code extensively.
```

```python
outtweets = [[tweet.id_str, tweet.created_at, tweet.text] for tweet in all_tweets]
```

ChatGPT gives me an extensive explanation!

```plaintext
outtweets = []   // create an empty list to hold the transformed tweets
for each tweet in all_tweets:   // loop through each tweet in the list of tweets
    outtweet = []   // create an empty list to hold the transformed tweet
    outtweet.append(tweet.id_str)   // append the tweet's ID to the outtweet list
    outtweet.append(tweet.created_at)   // append the tweet's creation date and time to the outtweet list
    outtweet.append(tweet.text)   // append the tweet's text to the outtweet list
    outtweets.append(outtweet)   // append the outtweet list to the outtweets list
```

### An Abstract Explanation

To generalize the understanding, we need to know each component of this code and its purpose in the overall functionality.

The prompt:

```plaintext
For this code:
outtweets = [[tweet.id_str, tweet.created_at, tweet.text] for tweet in all_tweets]
give me the official abstracted names (like those that would be referenced in a textbook about the Python interpreter) of the components one by one, then recreate the code using the abstracted names.
```

And this is what ChatGPT gave me:

> This code is a list comprehension that constructs a list called outtweets. The components involved in this code are:
> 
> - List Comprehension: A compact way to create a list using a single line of code.
> - Loop Variable: A variable used to iterate through the elements of an iterable (in this case, tweet).
> - Iterable: The collection that the loop iterates through (in this case, all_tweets).
> - Expression: The output expression that defines the structure of the elements in the new list (in this case, [tweet.id_str, tweet.created_at, tweet.text]).

### ChatGPT, Give me Use Cases

Now that we have a general understanding, let's get examples that are relevant to us.

The prompt:

```plaintext
Give me 3 use cases for list comprehensions. Embed them in a real project like collecting data from reddit or twitter to do some sort of analysis. Break it down in terms of
- purpose for using the list comprehension
- what the new list is for
- how I’m using an expression to transform items in the old list
- code example:
```

Here’s what ChatGPT gave me.

- Use Case 3: Calculating the sentiment scores of a list of Reddit posts

> Purpose for using the list comprehension: To calculate and store the sentiment scores of a list of Reddit posts using a sentiment analysis function, such as one from a library like TextBlob.
> 
> What the new list is for: Storing the calculated sentiment scores for further analysis, like identifying trends or finding correlations with other variables.
> 
> How I’m using an expression to transform items in the old list: By iterating through the list of Reddit posts and applying the sentiment analysis function to the ‘title’ attribute of each post object.

Code example:
 
 ```python
 from text

blob import TextBlob
posts = [...]  # List of Reddit post objects
def get_sentiment_score(text):
    return TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
sentiment_scores = [get_sentiment_score(post.title) for post in posts]
```

## Summing Up

So let’s go over the steps I use to learn something deeply.

1. **Explain Plainly**: Understand the purpose.
2. **Translate to Pseudocode**: Convert to something familiar.
3. **Map Pseudocode Back to Python Code**: Understand the connection between pseudocode and Python.
4. **Abstract Explanation**: Understand abstract components.
5. **Use Cases**: Visualize practical applications.

Use these steps and ChatGPT prompts next time you face a tough programming concept!
