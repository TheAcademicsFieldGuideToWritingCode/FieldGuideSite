# “Nathan, I’m a Computer Scientist, not a Software Engineer”
*A retort by one of my favourite professors as I roasted his illegible code.*

I didn’t know this until I got into academia, but there is a stark contrast. Computer Science is not about writing quality code, it’s about exploring computational problems (give or take). This means many Computer Scientists aren’t trained or interested in writing high quality code. Moreover, Computer Scientists aren’t the only ones writing code in academia. Far from it. I’ve spoken to dozens of psychologists, sociologists, physicists, and more about how they use or would like to use programming in their research.

Computational methods for simulation, data collection, data cleaning, analysis, generating stimuli and interventions, are powerful and useful no matter the domain. But, there’s a tall barrier to entry.

What’s taught in intro to Computer Science courses in academia is a self-serving set of constructs to prepare computer science students for more computer science. It does little to prepare people to use programming to solve the actual problems they face … or even to identify which problems can be solved programmatically.

## What is the Academic’s Field Guide to Writing Code?
*The Academic’s Field Guide to Writing Code* is going to be a practical set of tutorials, examples, and tricks of the trade to make writing and using code as easy as possible. We’ll go over the basics as practically and minimally as possible so you don’t have to futz around with the minutae.

### Examples of What we’ll Cover
- How to use python to gather data from social media
- How to create visual stimuli simply and easily
- How to share code with collaborators using Git and Version Control
- How to set up your editor to help you write code
- How to do basic statistical analysis in Python

We’re open to suggestions and welcome questions. I want the *Academics Field Guide to Coding* to be easy to use, and serve real needs. I’ll be reaching out to both professional software engineers and academics using code to find out what people need and the best ways to get that to them.

I hope this is helpful and I look forward to serving the academic community with these tutorials.

Cheers,
