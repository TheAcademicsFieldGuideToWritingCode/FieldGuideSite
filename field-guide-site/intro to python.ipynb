    "## The Mind of a Python: A Conceptual Understanding for Psychology Students\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello there, psychology enthusiasts! Today, let's visualize Python, a common programming language, using concepts from psychology. Don't worry, no actual coding in this module, but a conceptual understanding that you, as psychology students, will relate to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python as the Brain's Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as our brain uses a language of neurons and synapses to process information, Python uses variables, data types, and functions in a similar way. Consider the brain. It receives inputs from the environment, processes them, and then produces outputs. Python does the same. It takes inputs (data), processes it (runs a program), and then gives an output (results).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables: The Memory of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python are like the brain's memory system. Just as we store information in our memory to recall it later, Python uses variables to store and recall data. A variable can be a number, a piece of text, or even a list of items. And, just like our memory, variables in Python can store different types of data and can be changed or manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions: Pythonâ€™s Mental Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "If you consider the way we think or process information as a function of the brain, then Python functions can be seen as Python's way of thinking or processing information. Just as our brain takes in stimuli, processes it through complex cognitive functions, and then produces a response, Python functions take in data, process it, and produce an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops: Python's Habit Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "We all know, as psychology students, that repeated exposure to certain stimuli can lead to habit formation. In Python, this concept can be compared to loops. A loop is a piece of programming that repeats a specific set of instructions until a certain condition is met. Just like forming a habit through repetition, a loop allows Python to repeatedly perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Statements: Python's Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are like our brain's decision-making process. When faced with a decision, our brain evaluates the situation, considers the possible outcomes, and makes a decision based on these factors. Similarly, in Python, conditional statements allow the program to evaluate data and make decisions based on the conditions set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors: Python's Learning Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, just like we learn from our mistakes, Python has a system for learning from errors. When Python encounters an error, it stops and gives out an error message, telling us what went wrong. This allows us to correct our mistakes and write better code, just like how we learn and grow from our mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there you have it! Python, much like our brain, is a complex system that takes in data, processes it, and produces an output. By understanding these basic concepts, you'll be well on your way to learning Python programming! So, let's take this journey together, exploring the mind of Python, one concept at a time."

    "# Concrete Understanding of Python Syntax - A Detailed Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to our Python journey! Today, we're going to delve into the beautiful world of Python syntax. As psychology students, you already know how important it is to understand the structure (or syntax) of the things we study. So, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Types \n",
    "Variables are used to store information. In Python, you don't need to specify the type of variable (like in many other programming languages). Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Psychology\"\n",
    "number = 101\n",
    "print(text, \" \", number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `text` is a string (a sequence of characters) and `number` is an integer (a whole number). `print` is a function that outputs to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "Lists are a type of data structure in Python that can hold different types of items. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "topics = [\"Neuro\", \"Behavioral\", \"Cognitive\"]\n",
    "print(topics[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `topics` is a list that contains three strings. We can access list items by their indices - `topics[0]` gives us the first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Flow - If, Else, Elif\n",
    "These statements are used for decision making in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"A\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"B\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"C\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, we first check if the `score` is 90 or above. If it's true, we print \"A\". If it's not true, we move onto the next condition (using `elif` which stands for \"else if\") and check if the `score` is 80 or above. If that's true, we print \"B\". If none of our conditions are met, we print \"C\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops - For and While\n",
    "Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for topic in topics:\n",
    "    print(topic)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `for` loop goes through each item in the `topics` list and prints it. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `while` loop continues as long as the condition (`i < 5`) is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "Functions are reusable pieces of code. They only run when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Psychology Student\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, we defined a function `greet` that takes one argument `name`. When we call the function with the argument \"Psychology Student\", it prints \"Hello, Psychology Student\".\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for today's session! Remember, practice is key in programming. Try these examples, play around with them, and make them your own! Happy coding!"

    "**Example 1: Analyzing Psychological Survey Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll use Python to analyze a dataset from a psychological survey. Let's assume that we have a CSV file named `survey_data.csv` containing responses to a personality test. Our goal is to find the average score for each personality trait.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Importing necessary libraries\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the data \n",
    "data = pd.read_csv('survey_data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the first few rows of the dataset\n",
    "print(data.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this block of code, we first import the pandas library which will allow us to load and analyze our data. We then load our data from the CSV file and display the first few rows to get a sense of what our data looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's calculate the average score for each personality trait. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate the mean of each column\n",
    "mean_scores = data.mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the mean scores\n",
    "print(mean_scores)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the `mean()` function calculates the average score for each column (personality trait) in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Visualizing Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common task in Psychology is data visualization. For instance, we might want to visualize the distribution of scores for a certain trait. We'll use the matplotlib library for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Importing necessary library\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot a histogram of the 'Openness' trait\n",
    "data['Openness'].hist()\n",
    "plt.title('Distribution of Openness Scores')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Score')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Frequency')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we first import the matplotlib library. Then, we create a histogram of the 'Openness' scores using `hist()`. The `title()`, `xlabel()`, and `ylabel()` functions are used to set the title of the plot and the labels of the x and y axes, respectively. Finally, `show()` is used to display the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3: Statistical Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can also be used to perform statistical tests. Let's say we want to determine if there is a significant difference between the scores of males and females for a certain trait. We can use the scipy library to perform a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Importing necessary library\n",
    "from scipy import stats\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform a t-test between the scores of males and females\n",
    "t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(data[data['Gender'] == 'Male']['Trait'], \n",
    "                                 data[data['Gender'] == 'Female']['Trait'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the result\n",
    "print(f'T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_val}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we first import the stats module from the scipy library. We then use the `ttest_ind()` function to perform a t-test on the scores of males and females. The function returns the t-statistic and the p-value, which we print out.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a small sample of what you can do with Python in the field of Psychology. With these basic tools, plus knowledge of some additional libraries and functions, you can perform a wide variety of analyses on psychological data."

    "4. Generate a bar graph showing the average stress level of each age group.\n",
    "5. Save the results to a new CSV file called `mental_health_analysis.csv`.\n",
